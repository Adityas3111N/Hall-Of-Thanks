// This code is like a wrapper to safely access .env variables in a structured
//  and reusable way. bcz we always need these variables in string form.


// While working on the project, if you think, "Where are my Appwrite settings?"
// Youâ€™ll instinctively know to check conf.js because the name makes it obvious.

// "conf" is a shorthand for configuration, which perfectly describes what this file does:
// It configures your app by pulling environment variables and organizing them in one place.
